      <ul>
        <li><strong>1977 </strong>- Mirzakhani was born on May 12 in Tehran, Iran.</li>
        <li><strong>1994 </strong>- Mirzakhani became the first Iranian woman to win a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points.</li>
        <li><strong>1995 </strong>- In Toronto, she became the first Iranian to achieve the full score and to win two gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad.</li>
        <li><strong>1995 - 1999
           </strong>- Institute for Research in Fundamental Science, Fellowship, Tehran, Iran</li>
        <li><strong>1998 </strong>- On March 17th, after attending a conference consisting of gifted individuals and former Olympiad competitors, Mirzakhani and Zavareh, along with other attendees, boarded a bus in Ahvaz en route to Tehran. The bus was involved in an accident wherein it fell off a cliff, killing seven passengers—all Sharif University students. This incident is widely considered a national tragedy in Iran. Mirzakhani and Zavareh were two of the few survivors.</li>
        <li><strong>1999 </strong>- In collaboration with friend, colleague, and Olympiad silver medalist, Roya Beheshti Zavareh (Persian: رؤیا بهشتی زواره), they published a book titled 'Elementary Number Theory, Challenging Problems'.</li>
        <li><strong>1999 </strong>- She obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology.</li>
        <li><strong>2003 </strong>- Merit fellowship Harvard University and Harvard Junior Fellowship Harvard University</li>
        <li><strong>2004 </strong>- She obtained a Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she worked under the supervision of the Fields Medalist, Curtis T. McMullen.</li>
        <li><strong>2004 </strong>- Mirzakhani was a research fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and a professor at Princeton University.</li>
        <li><strong>2005 </strong>- Popular Science's "Brilliant 10"; one of the top 10 young minds who have pushed their fields in innovative directions.</li>
        <li><strong>2008 </strong>- Mirzakhani married Jan Vondrák, a Czech theoretical computer scientist and applied mathematician who is currently a professor at Stanford University. They have one daughter.</li>
        <li><strong>2009 </strong>- She became a professor at Stanford University.</li>
        <li><strong>2009 </strong>- American Mathematical Society, Blumenthal Award</li>
        <li><strong>2010 </strong>- Invited to talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians, on the topic of "Topology and Dynamical Systems & ODE"</li>
        <li><strong>2013 </strong>- The AMS Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics. Presented every two years by the American Mathematical Society, the Satter Prize recognizes an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by a woman in the preceding six years. The prize was awarded on January 10th, at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.</li>
        <li><strong>2013 </strong>- Won the Simons Investigator Award </li>
        <li><strong>2013 </strong>- Mirzakhani was diagnosed with breast cancer.</li>
        <li><strong>2014 </strong>- On August 13th, at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Seoul, South Korea, Mirzakhani became the <strong>first woman</strong> to be awarded the Fields Medal for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces." </li>
        <li><strong>2014 </strong>- Named one of Nature magazine's ten "people who mattered"</li>
        <li><strong>2014 </strong>- Won the Clay Research Award</li>
        <li><strong>2014 </strong>- Students at the University of Oxford founded the Mirzakhani Society, a society for women and non-binary students studying Mathematics at the University of Oxford. Mirzakhani met the society in September 2015, when she visited Oxford.</li>
        <li><strong>2015 </strong>- Elected foreign associate to the French Academy of Sciences.</li>
        <li><strong>2015 </strong>- Elected to the American Philosophical Society</li>
        <li><strong>2016 </strong>- Maryam Mirzakhani was made a member of the National Academy of Sciences (of the United States), making her the first Iranian woman to be officially accepted as a member of the academy.</li>
        <li><strong>2016 </strong>- The cancer spread to her bones and liver</li>
        <li><strong>2017 </strong>- Farzanegan High School – the high school Mirzakhani formerly attended – named their amphitheater and library after her. Additionally, the Sharif University of Technology, where Mirzakhani obtained her bachelor's, has since named their main library in the College of Mathematics after her. Further, the House of Mathematics in Isfahan, in collaboration with the Mayor, named a conference hall in the city after her.</li>
        <li><strong>2017 </strong>- She died on July 14th at the age of 40 at Stanford Hospital in Stanford, California</li>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"[Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other things, she studies billiards. But now, in a move very characteristic of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just one billiard table, but the universe of all possible billiard tables. And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern the motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet around the universe of all possible tables ... <strong>This isn't the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to expose the dynamics at the heart of geometry; for there's no question that they're there.</strong>"</p>
